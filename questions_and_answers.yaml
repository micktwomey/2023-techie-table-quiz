          Agnus is the central chip in the design of the Amiga. It controlled all access to chip RAM from both the central 68000 processor and the other custom chips.

          The original Agnus can address 512 KB of chip RAM. Later revisions, dubbed 'Fat Agnus', added 512 KB pseudo-fast RAM, which for ECS was changed to 1 MB (sometimes called 'Fatter Agnus') and subsequently to 2 MB chip RAM.

          The other chips on the amiga were Denise (for video processing) and Paula (for audio processing)

          Funyon: An onion-flavored corn snacks came about in 1969 and break from chip form with their ring shapes
